    "\n",
    "The law of large numbers and the central limit theorem both tell us that, when we have a big sample, the mean of the sample will be pretty close to the mean for the overall population. If we act as if the same is true for small samples, we will make some wrong inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we simulate large and small counties. For each, we simulate the observed kidney cancer rate in a given year. Because small counties are effectively small samples, there is higher variance in the observed kidney rates, even if the underlying true rates are exactly the same. Higher variance means that both the lowest **and** highest observed cancer rates will come from small counties. We shouldn't be fooled into thinking there's actually a difference in the cancer rates."
