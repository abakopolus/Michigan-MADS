    "\n",
    "- Review, reflect on, and apply different strategies for multidimensional/multivariate/temporal datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recreate visualizations and propose new and alternative visualizations using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) \n",

    "- You will be producing four visualizations. Three of them will require you to follow the example closely, but the last will be fairly open-ended. For the last one, we'll also ask you to justify why you designed your visualization the way you did.\n",

    "\n",
    "2) Keep your notebooks clean and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) There are a few instances where our numbers do not align exactly with those from 538. We've pre-processed our data a little bit differently (had different exclusion criteria on guests and for some images we could not process the color data so we excluded those rows).\n",

    "## Bob Ross\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's assignment will have you working with artwork created by [Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross). Bob was a very famous painter who had a televised painting show from 1983 to 1994. Over 13 seasons and approximately 400 paintings, Bob would walk the audience through a painting project. Often these were landscape images. Bob was famous for telling his audience to paint \"happy trees\" and sayings like, \"We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents.\" His soothing voice and bushy hair are well known to many generations of viewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never seen an episode, I might suggest starting with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw6odlNp7_8). \n",
    "\n",
    "![bob ross](assets/bobrosspaints.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob Ross left a long legacy of art which makes for an interesting dataset to analyze. It's both temporally rich and has a lot of variables we can code. We'll be starting with the dataset created by 538 for their article on a [Statistical Analysis of Bob Ross](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/). The authors of the article coded each painting to indicate what features the image contained (e.g., one tree, more than one tree, what kinds of clouds, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we've downloaded a second dataset that contains the actual images. We know what kind of paint colors Bob used in each episode, and we have used that to create a dataset for you containing the color distributions. For example, we approximate how much '<font color='#614f4b'>burnt umber</font>' he used by measuring the distance (in color space) from each pixel in the image to the color. We then add the 'similarity' of each pixel to the burnt umber RGB value into the respective column. This is imperfect, of course (paints don't mix this way), but it'll be close enough for our analysis. Note that the sum of those rows will not add to 1 and the total value for any column can be more than 1. The only thing we can guarantee is that the metric is consistent across colors and between paintings."

    "The 538 article ([Statistical Analysis of Bob Ross](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/)) has a long analysis of conditional probabilities. Essentially, we want to know the probability of one feature given another (e.g., what is the probability of Snow given Trees?). The article calculates this over the entire history of the show, but we would like to visualize these probabilities over time. Have they been constant? or evolving?  We will only be doing this for a few variables (otherwise, we'll have a matrix of over 3000 small charts). The example below is for: 'At least one tree','At least two trees','Clouds','Grass','At least one mountain','Lake.' Each small multiple plot will be a line chart corresponding to the conditional probability over time. The matrix \"cell\" indicates which pairs of variables are being considered (e.g., probability of at least two trees given the probability of at least one tree is the 2nd row, first column in our example).\n",

This is simply an implementation of Conditional Probability/Bayes' Theorem. We implemented a function called ```condprobability(...)``` as you can see below. You can do the same or pick your own strategy for this.\n",

You will find in this case that some combinations of repeated charts and faceting will not work. However, you should be able to use the standard concatenation approaches in combination with repeated charts or faceting."

Despite this change, the output above has the same expressiveness as the sample plot and the decision to make this change was driven by readability. On such a small plot, the greater number of tick marks made it more difficult to view the lines themselves.

    "Your last problem is fairly open-ended in terms of visualization. We would like to analyze the colors used in different images for a given season as a small multiples plot. You can pick how you represent your small multiples, but we will ask you to defend your choices below.  You must implement the function ```colorSmallMultiples(season)``` that takes a season number as input (e.g., 2) and returns an Altair chart. The \"multiples\" should be at the painting level--so, one multiple per painting (and each TV season shown at once).\n",

    "This visualization has a row for every painting and a colored circle (in the color of the paint). The circle is sized based on the amount of the corresponding paint that is used in the image. \n",

This is a “rough” check, but if you’re not using repeating, faceting, concatenation, etc. you’re probably just making one chart (e.g., a heatmap). Another check is if there are axis labels/information on each so that it’s readable on its own (a shared legend is fine). All these are inexact tests but may be helpful as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) You *may* find it useful to implement \"colorSmallMultiple\" as below to generate your single small multiple. This may not be ideal if you're using faceting or repetition.

    "My design uses circles as the mark that have been colored based on the color they correspond to in the painting. A color's \"prevalence\" in a painting is encoded as x-position, and a tooltip encoding allows for a reader to scan over a mark and see the painting's name, the color the circle corresponds to, and its \"prevalence\" within the painting. Lastly, a row encoding allowed for this small multiple visualization, as each painting from a season is given its own row, with the title of each painting available as a label. The function to generate the visualization will just need to take a season input and will generate the above design.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design used for the visualization would be perhaps the same level of expressiveness as the two sample examples, but would be a much more effective presentation of the data. The two sample visualizations rely on a size encoding to display the prevalence of colors in each of the paintings from a particular season. Viewers have more difficulty comparing the size of one object to another, and, therefore, a significant pro of my visualization is to encode a color's \"prevalence\" by x-position instead. A reader can now see much easier which colors were used in a painting and to the level in which they were used. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to encoding prevalence in a more user-friendly way, my visualization I believe is also far more effective due to providing x-axis ticks and a tooltip encoding. A viewer is able to clearly see and compare prevalence based on the x-axis ticks, but can also get more exact information by hovering over a mark and seeing the color name and its exact prevalence. The sample encodings did encode prevalence based on size but no legend was available, which would have made comparisons and magnitude difficult to assess. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of a con, there is a trade-off between mark size and visualization height and width. There are cases where multiple marks do overlap, making hovering with the tooltip encoding difficult as well as the viewer's ability to assess which colors are included and their prevalence. The mark size and visualization height/width were chosen to be as clear as possible for the viewer while not resulting in too large of a display, but color overlaps would still be a clear con for this design approach."
