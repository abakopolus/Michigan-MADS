    "Hello team!\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a new dental office that would like some help automating their calendar services. You will have five hours to complete this task. (This lab is based on the AWS's training materials and was modified for the purposes of this project.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup: Accessing the AWS Management Console\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the **Start Lab** button in the top right of the screen. (It may take up to five minutes for your lab to start. Once your lab is ready, the modal dialog will indicate so.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Click the **AWS** button in the top left of the screen to gain access to AWS. (There should be a green circle next to it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  This will open the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab. The system will automatically log you in.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Tip**: If a new browser tab does not open, there will typically be a banner or icon at the top of your browser that indicates that your browser is preventing the website from opening pop-up windows. Select the banner or icon and then select **Allow pop ups**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Arrange the **AWS Management Console** browser tab so that it displays next to these instructions. Ideally, you should be able to see both browser tabs at the same time, which can make it easier to follow the lab steps.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Task 1: Make the bot!\n",
    "\n",
    "For our client, you will create a bot by using the AWS Management Console.\n",

    "11. Click **Create**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2: Test your bot \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will test your bot by using the test window in the console. It is very important to validate that your bot works.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see the status \"Ready. Build complete\" or \"ScheduleAppointment build was successful,\" you can now test the bot in the test window. Test your bot by entering the following values:\n",

    "- `I would like to make an appointment`\n",
    "- `A root canal`\n",
    "- `5/1/2020`\n",

    "## Task 5: Updating the intent of your bot\n",
    "\n",
    "Each bot you create in Amazon Lex has an *intent*. The intent is an action that the bot will fulfill. In this task, you will update the intent to use the AWS Lambda function that you created.\n",

    "\n",
    "35.  Click **Build** in the top right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are prompted with a message that says that you can continue to edit your bot while it builds.\n",
    "\n",
    "36.  Click **Build**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the build is complete, you should receive a confirmation that your bot build was successful.\n",

    "## Incorporating your bot into a webpage\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your bot is working, it's time to test it by running it from a webpage. The easiest way to do the test is to create a static webpage and host it on Amazon S3. The webpage will invoke the Amazon Lex API to load your bot. Visitors to the webpage can then interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 7: Setting up an Amazon Cognito identity pool\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now set up a webpage for testing your appointment bot. This webpage will be hosted in Amazon S3 as a static webpage. To add security to this page, you must first set up an Amazon Cognito identity pool. \n",

    "\n",
    "47. Click **Allow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**:Make note of the **IdentityPoolID** under \"Get AWS Credentials\" because you will need this ID later in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 8: Modifying IAM roles to allow access to Amazon Lex\n",
    "\n",
    "The webpage that hosts your bot must be allowed to access Amazon Lex. To do this, the two roles that were created in the Amazon Cognito identity pool need permissions to access Amazon Lex. You must configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant these permissions to the identity pool roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "48. Enter \"IAM\" in the search bar in the top left of the screen, and select **IAM** from the search results.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Task 9: Creating an S3 bucket \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you set up the security permissions, you must create an S3 bucket to host your webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "56. Click the **Jupyter logo** at the top of this notebook where you are reading these instructions. You should see a folder called \"Chatbot\" that contains `index.html` and `error.html`. Download both files and return to these instructions.\n",
